\section{Infos}
There is neither a lower nor an upper bound on the number of pages. Assume that
the reader is familiar with Ethereum and Smart Contracts, and just write what
is necessary. It is a technical report, not an essay, so stick to the facts. As
a sign of professionalism, proofread the paper and eliminate spelling and
grammatical errors. You may use chatGPT or a similar tool to polish the paper,
but take care that it does not introduce nonsense.

Write the paper in English. Typeset it in \LaTeX. The document class
\verb"article" is fine, but you may use fancier formatting if you prefer. See
the source of this document for an example.

For Solidity code, add the line  \verb"\usepackage{solidity}" to your preamble
and wrap the code in a \verb"solidity" environment, like below.
\begin{solidity}
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
contract HelloWorld {
    string public greet = "Hello World!";
}
\end{solidity}
