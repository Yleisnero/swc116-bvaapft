\section{Introduction}
This report deals with a weakness in Solidity smart contracts, which is called
"block values as a proxy for time". This weakness is described in the Smart
Contract Weakness Classification (SWC) registry under the number 116. \newline
The weakness comes from the attempt of developers to introduce time depended
functionality in their smart contracts, by reading the values block.timestamp
or block.number \cite{swc116}. \newline

\section{Consequences}
If one of the described weaknesses occurs in a smart contract it can happen, that e.g. users of the smart contract can not access
their ethereum or other information stored in the contract as shown in Example 2. \newline
Also it can happen that a miner is gaining an unfair advantage if he is able to set the timestamp of his mined block into the future,
such that he is able to access resources earlier then other user as shown in Example 1.
