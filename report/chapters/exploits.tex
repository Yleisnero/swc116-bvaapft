\section{Exploits}
In order to exploit a smart contract containing a "block values as a proxy for time" weakness,
several conditions must be met. First, the attacker needs to function as a miner, capable of successfully
including their manipulated block in the blockchain. This manipulation involves altering the block values, effectively
utilizing them as a substitute for time \cite{swc116}.
Additionally, the attacker not only manipulates the block values but must also ensure that the advantageous transaction is included 
in the manipulated block which was successfully introduced into the blockchain \cite{cryptomarket}.
