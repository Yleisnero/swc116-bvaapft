\section{Conclusion: Using block values for time under PoW vs PoS}

In PoW-based Ethereum, block times were probabilistic and influenced by mining difficulty.
As a result, using block values as a time proxy in PoW was not secure.
However, since Ethereum's transition to PoS, this is no longer the case.
PoS-based Ethereum has fixed block times of 12 seconds or multiples thereof.
Our research has shown that block times can no longer be influenced from external sources.
Therefore, using the block.timestamp value as a time proxy is now safe in PoS.

Using the block.number as a proxy for time is still not advisable. Block times 
can become a multiple of 12s and it is also not guaranteed that the block intervals will
never change again in the future.
