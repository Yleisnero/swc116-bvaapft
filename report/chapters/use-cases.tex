\section{Use-cases}

\subsection{Timelocks}
A timelock is a smart contract that serves as a mechanism to delay function calls form another contract for
a predefined amount of time. Timelocks find their primary application in governance systems,
where they play a crucial role in implementing delayed administrative actions.
Their presence often signifies the credibility of a project and underscores the commitment of its owners
to its long-term success. \cite{timelock2021}.

Openzeppelin provides such a timelock in their library (@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/TimelockController.sol).
A part of this timelock code can be seen in Listing \ref{lst:timelock} \cite{timelock_code}.
