\section{Best practices}
\subsection{Best practices under PoS}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Do not use block.number as a proxy for time.
  \item Do not use block.timestamp to trigger exact timings.
  \item Do not use block.timestamp in a comparison, instead use $>$ or $>=$.
  \item It is secure to use block.timestamp for time-dependent events, if it is acceptable for these events to occur later (until the next block) than anticipated. \\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Best practices under PoW}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Do not use block.number as a proxy for time.
  \item Do not use block.timestamp to trigger exact timings.
  \item Do not use block.timestamp in a comparison, instead use $>$ or $>=$.
  \item It is secure to use block.timestamp for time-dependent events, if it is acceptable for these events to take place up to 15 seconds earlier than expected or later (until the next block). \\
\end{itemize}

\section{Use-cases}

The table below presents a range of potential use-cases for contracts that
utilize block timestamps and block numbers. It also provides a usage recommendation
for each use-case under both PoS and PoW frameworks. These contracts serve as
examples and focus solely on issues related to block values, excluding any
other types of vulnerabilities. Refer to Appendix (see Section \ref{appendix})
for the contracts code.
