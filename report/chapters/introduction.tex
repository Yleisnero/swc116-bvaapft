\section{Introduction}

Smart contracts often utilize time values to trigger specific actions. The
values that can be employed for this purpose include the block timestamp and
the block number. However, under the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism in
Ethereum, using these values has been associated with various security issues
\cite{swc116} \cite{Conkas2021} \cite{DASP2018} \cite{Osiris2018}
\cite{Oyente2016}.

Since the transition to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in
Ethereum, significant changes have occurred in how the timestamp value has to
be set and in the stability of the block time. This paper aims to discuss these
changes.
