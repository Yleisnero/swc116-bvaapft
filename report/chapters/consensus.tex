\section{Ethereum's Consensus Mechanisms}
Ethereum initially adopted the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, a process known
for its security and decentralization but also criticized for its high energy
consumption and potential for centralization due to mining pools. PoW requires
miners to solve complex computational problems to validate transactions and
create new blocks, a process that consumes substantial computational power and
energy \cite{eth_pow}.

In response to these concerns, Ethereum transitioned to the Proof-of-Stake
(PoS) mechanism with "The Merge" on September 15, 2022. PoS, in contrast to
PoW, selects validators to create new blocks based on the number of coins they
hold and are willing to 'stake' as collateral. This approach significantly
reduces the energy requirements and aims to offer a more scalable and
environmentally friendly alternative \cite{eth_merge}.
