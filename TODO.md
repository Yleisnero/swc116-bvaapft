# Characterize the SC weakness assigned to you.

- Describe the various forms it may take and construct minimal sample contracts for each variant. Also describe variants that look similar but are not a weakness, and construct minimal contracts for these non-weaknesses.
- Describe the consequences if the weakness is exploited.
- Collect vulnerable contracts used by the papers to motivate/illustrate the weakness.
- Summarize the code properties that tools are looking for so that they can detect the weakness.
- Sketch ways to potentially exploit the different variants of the weakness.

As reading material, we suggest the entries in the SWC and OpenSCV registry, the linked tool papers and the publications listed with your weakness (if there is any).
You may also find useful information in the more general papers listed as "further reading".

Everone should upload a paper on Tuwel, even when you work in a group (can be the same document, though). If several people contribute to the paper, list them as authors. Clearly, you should be among the authors of the paper that you upload.

For information on how to format the paper, see these notes; the source files of this PDF are in seminar.zip.
